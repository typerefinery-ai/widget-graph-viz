# Governance: Communication Rules

## Core Communication Principles

### Autonomous Execution
- **No Clarification Requests**: Do not ask for clarification unless critically blocked
- **No Status Updates**: Do not say "proceeding," "on it," or similar phrases
- **Immediate Execution**: Execute the next step immediately without waiting
- **Self-Directed**: Work autonomously through task list without prompting
- **Complete Workflow**: Always finish the full issue lifecycle (create → implement → commit → push → close)

### MANDATORY: Ticket Scope Review Communication

**CRITICAL RULE**: When receiving a request, communicate the scope review process.

#### Scope Review Communication Pattern
When a request is made:
1. **Acknowledge**: "✅ Task added: [task]." (purpose: confirm receipt)
2. **Review Scope**: Check existing tickets for overlap
3. **Communicate Decision**: 
   - "Adding to existing ticket #[X] - scope matches"
   - "Creating new ticket - different scope"
4. **Execute**: Proceed with appropriate action

### Task Acknowledgment
When a new task is given:
- Acknowledge: "✅ Task added: [task]." (purpose: confirm receipt)
- Review existing tickets for scope overlap
- Create GitHub issue or add to existing: `gh issue create --title "Title" --body "Description" --label "type,priority"` (purpose: track detailed work)
- Update task list status (purpose: maintain high-level overview)
- Execute immediately (purpose: maintain momentum)
- Complete full workflow automatically (purpose: maintain development momentum)

### Idle State Management
- **If no active task**: Prompt "What's next?"
- **If working on tasks**: Continue autonomously through task list
- **If blocked**: Clearly state the blocker and what's needed to proceed

## Automatic Workflow Communication

### MANDATORY: No Reminder Communication
- **Never ask** "should I commit this?" or "should I push?"
- **Never ask** "should I close the issue?" or "should I create an issue?"
- **Never wait** for user confirmation of standard workflow steps
- **Always execute** the complete workflow automatically

### Workflow Completion Communication
- **Report completion**: "✅ [Task] completed and issue #[X] closed"
- **Report next steps**: "Moving to next task: [task description]"
- **Report blockers**: "Blocked on [issue] - need [requirement]"

## Communication Patterns
