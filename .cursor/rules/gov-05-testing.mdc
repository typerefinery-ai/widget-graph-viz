# Governance: Universal Testing Principles

## Core Testing Philosophy

### MANDATORY: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**CRITICAL RULE**: Every code change MUST follow TDD approach with issue creation first.

#### 1. Issue-First TDD Workflow (MANDATORY)
1. **Create GitHub Issue**: Document requirement before any code
2. **E2E Test First**: Create end-to-end test that reflects real user flow (purpose: define acceptance criteria)
3. **Minimal Implementation**: Implement only what makes the E2E test pass (purpose: avoid over-engineering)
4. **Unit Test Coverage**: Add unit tests for reusable logic (purpose: ensure code reliability)
5. **Test Maintenance**: Update existing tests for changed behavior (purpose: maintain test integrity)

#### 2. TDD Enforcement Rules
- **No Code Without Test**: Never write implementation code without a failing test first
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Follow the classic TDD cycle strictly
- **Test Defines Requirements**: Let tests drive the implementation design
- **Minimal Implementation**: Only implement what's needed to make tests pass

### Testing Hierarchy
- **E2E Tests**: Validate complete user workflows (MUST be written first)
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and methods
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure existing functionality remains intact

## Test Organization

### Test Structure
- Use isolated test directories to prevent interference
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Organize tests by functionality and scope
- Maintain clear test descriptions

### Test Execution
- Run tests in isolation to prevent side effects
- Use cleanup procedures to maintain clean state
- Execute tests in predictable order
- Capture and report test results consistently

### Test Artifacts
- Generate comprehensive test reports
- Log test execution details
- Preserve test outputs for analysis
- Clean up test artifacts after completion

## Quality Standards

### Test Reliability
- Tests must be deterministic and repeatable
- Avoid flaky tests and race conditions
- Use proper setup and teardown procedures
- Handle external dependencies appropriately

### Test Coverage
- Aim for comprehensive coverage of critical paths
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Test error conditions and failure scenarios
- Validate both positive and negative test cases

### Test Performance
- Keep tests fast and efficient
- Use parallel execution where appropriate
- Minimize external dependencies
- Cache test data when possible

## Testing Workflow

### MANDATORY: TDD Development Process

#### 1. Issue Creation Phase
- Create GitHub issue with detailed requirements
- Define acceptance criteria clearly
- Plan implementation approach

#### 2. Test Creation Phase
- Write E2E test that defines user flow
- Ensure test fails initially (red phase)
- Define clear acceptance criteria in test

#### 3. Implementation Phase
- Write minimal code to make test pass (green phase)
- Focus only on making the test pass
- Avoid over-engineering

#### 4. Refactoring Phase
- Clean up code while keeping tests passing
- Improve design without changing behavior
- Add unit tests for reusable logic

#### 5. Validation Phase
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
- Verify all acceptance criteria are met
- Document any changes made

### Local Development
1. **Quick Test**: Run individual test files for rapid iteration
2. **Full Test**: Run complete test suite for comprehensive validation
3. **Specific Test**: Use targeted test execution for focused validation
4. **Clean Test**: Use cleanup to ensure clean test environment

### Continuous Integration
1. **Automated Testing**: Run tests on every code change
2. **Cross-Platform**: Test across different environments
3. **Artifact Collection**: Capture test outputs and reports
4. **Status Reporting**: Provide clear pass/fail indicators

### Regression Testing
- **Base Tests**: Always run to ensure core functionality remains intact
- **Progressive Testing**: Each new feature adds its tests to the regression suite
- **Full Suite Execution**: Run comprehensive testing for all changes
- **Isolated Testing**: Use specific test execution for targeted validation

## Test Maintenance

### Test Updates
- Update tests when functionality changes
- Maintain test relevance and accuracy
- Remove obsolete or redundant tests
- Refactor tests for better maintainability

### Test Documentation
- Document test purpose and scope
- Explain complex test scenarios
- Provide setup and execution instructions
- Keep test documentation current

### Test Review
- Review tests for completeness and accuracy
- Validate test coverage and effectiveness
- Ensure tests follow established patterns
- Identify opportunities for improvement

## TDD Best Practices

### Test Writing Guidelines
- Write tests that reflect real user behavior
- Focus on behavior, not implementation details
- Keep tests simple and readable
- Use descriptive test names

### Implementation Guidelines
- Write the simplest code that makes tests pass
- Don't add features not covered by tests
- Refactor frequently to improve design
- Keep implementation focused and minimal

### Quality Assurance
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Run full test suite after any changes
- Maintain test coverage metrics
- Review test quality regularly
