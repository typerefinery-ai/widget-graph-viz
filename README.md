# Teamplate iFrame Widget

This teamplate is mean to be used to create new experiences that can be included using iFrames into other application and websites.

## Installation

Create a new repository from this template.

Clone your new repository to your local machine.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

You can view the development server at [http://localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001).

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

### Where to add your code

Here are the main files and folders you will be working with:

#### Assets and Images

Add your assets and images into `src/assets/` folder. These will be copied into `dist/` folder as is

#### HTML

Add your custom HTML code into template `src/html/content.html`, this file will be added as innerHTML of the `body` element in templae `src/html/_index.html` file. This will be compiled into `dist/index.html`.

#### CSS

CSS is being compiled using SASS. Add your custom SASS code into template `src/sass/content.scss`, this will be compiled into `dist/widget.css`.

#### JS

Add your custom JS code into js files in `src/js/`. Each file will be concatanated into `dist/widget.js`. Files are concatanated in the order they are listed in the folder.

#### JS Vendor Libs

To add vendor JS libraries that will be compiled into `dist/vendor.js` and `dist/vendor.css` update the following section in `webpack.common.js`:

```javascript
new MergeIntoSingleFilePlugin({
        files: {
            "vendor.js": [
                'node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js',
                'node_modules/@popperjs/core/dist/umd/popper.js',
                'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js',
                'node_modules/d3/dist/d3.js',
            ],
            "vendor.css": [
                //nothing here yet
            ],
            "widget.js": [
                paths.src + '/js/**/*.js',
            ]
        }
    }),

```

##### JS Conventions

Please keep JS simple, clean and namespaced.

When adding new files "modules" use this as the template for your new module.

```javascript
//define namespace for your JS file
//window.Widgets = {};  //  already defined in _namespace.js
window.Widgets.Widget = {};

//define your function to use in your component
(function($, ns, componentsNs, document, window) {
    ns.version = '1.0.0';

    ns.selectorComponent = '.js-component';

    ns.init = function() {
        //initialize your class
    };

})(jQuery, Widgets.Widget, window.Widgets, document, window);

//define your behaviour how will this component will be added to DOM.
(function($, ns, componentsNs, document, window) {
    
    //watch for the component to be added to DOM
    componentsNs.watchDOMForComponent(`${ns.selectorComponent}`, ns.init);

})(window.jQuery, window.Widgets.Widget, window.Widgets, document, window);

```

### How to Raise Event from Widget

To leverage the event system, you can use the `eventsNs` object that is available in the global scope and should be added to your namespace as window.Widgets.Events.

To raise an event from the widget to the parent application, you can use the following code:

```javascript
    const eventName = "viz-open-form-" + formId;
    const config = formId;
    const action = "BUTTON_CLICK";

    console.log("compileEventData", formData, eventName, action, formId, config);

    const data = eventsNs.compileEventData(formData, eventName, action, formId, config);

    console.log(`event raise ${eventName}`, data);
    eventsNs.raiseEvent(eventName, data);
    console.log(`event raised ${eventName}`);
    console.groupEnd();
```

This will raise an event with the name `viz-open-form-<formId>` and the data will be the `formData` object.

### How to Listen to Event from Widget

To listen to an event from the widget in the parent application, you can use the following code:

```javascript
    ns.addEventListener = ($component, componentConfig) => {
        console.group(`addEventListener on ${window.location}`);
        const { events, id } = componentConfig;
        const defaultTopic = id;
  
        console.log(["config", events, id, defaultTopic]);

        console.log(["addEventListener windowListener"]);
        eventsNs.windowListener((data) => {
            console.group(`windowListener on ${window.location}`);
            console.log(data);
            const { type, payload, action, componentId, config } = data;
            console.log(["type", type]);
            console.log(["payload", payload]);
            console.log(["action", action]);
            console.log(["componentId", componentId]);
            console.log(["config", config]);
            // if (type === 'embed-viz-event-payload-data1') {
            //     console.log(["action match, loading data."]);
            //     ns.loadData(data);
            // }
            console.groupEnd();
        });

        console.log(["addEventListener windowListener done"]);
        console.groupEnd();
    }
```

You can see that the `windowListener` function is used to listen to events from the parent window with evebt payload that should be used to determine what widget should do.

### How to send event from parent application to widget

```javascript
Typerefinery.Page.Events.emitEvent("notifydatarefresh", Typerefinery.Page.Events.compileEventData({}, "notifydatarefresh", "DATA_REFRESH", "notifydatarefresh", null));
```

## Workbench: Iframe Communication Simulator

A browser-based workbench is provided for simulating parent <-> iframe communication and testing widget integration flows.

- **Location:** `src/html/workbench.html`
- **Features:**
  - Console-style UI for sending/receiving events
  - Action buttons for common widget/parent flows
  - Custom message and settings support
  - Live console output for all communication
  - Status indicator and reload controls

### Usage

1. Start the dev server: `npm start`
2. Open [http://localhost:4001/src/html/workbench.html](http://localhost:4001/src/html/workbench.html) in your browser.
3. Use the sidebar to send events/messages to the widget iframe.
4. All messages sent/received are logged in the console area.
5. You can reload the iframe, simulate errors, and test all widget/parent communication flows.

### E2E Testing the Workbench

A Cypress E2E test is provided:

- **Location:** `cypress/e2e/workbench.cy.js`
- **What it tests:**
  - Loads the workbench and widget iframe
  - Sends a message from workbench to widget and verifies it is logged
  - Simulates a message from the widget to the workbench and verifies it is logged

To run the test:

```bash
npm run test:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/workbench.cy.js"
```

### Configuration

- The iframe URL can be set in the workbench UI (Settings section) or by editing the default in `workbench.html`.
- The workbench is accessible at `/src/html/workbench.html` when running the dev server.

## Ticket Management Workflow (.tasks/ Folder)

All ticket updates must be performed via the `.tasks/` folder:
- Each ticket has a corresponding markdown file `.tasks/issue-<number>.md` with YAML metadata (issue number, title, status, timestamps, summary, etc.).
- Before updating a ticket, always fetch the latest from GitHub.
- Write/update the local markdown file with the new update and metadata.
- After local update, update the ticket on GitHub (edit body/status as needed).
- Commit and push all changes for traceability.
- All ticket changes must be reflected both locally and on GitHub.

**See project rules for full details.**
