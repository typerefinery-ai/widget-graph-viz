## Issue Description
Complete flow test is failing due to data loading verification issues in the end-to-end user journey.

## Current Status
- **Test File**: `cypress/e2e/complete-flow.cy.js`
- **Failing Test**: "should complete full user journey from local mode to widget mode"
- **Failure Point**: Data loading verification after mode switching

## Root Cause Analysis
The test expects data to be loaded and verified after switching from local mode to widget mode, but the verification is failing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete flow test passes consistently
- [ ] Data loading verification works after mode switching
- [ ] No regression in other test suites
- [ ] Test execution time remains reasonable

## Test Cases
- [ ] Local mode data loading works correctly
- [ ] Mode switching preserves data state
- [ ] Widget mode communication functions properly
- [ ] End-to-end user journey completes successfully

## Implementation Plan
1. Investigate data loading verification logic
2. Fix mode switching data preservation
3. Update test assertions if needed
4. Verify no breaking changes to other tests

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Run complete flow test: `npm run test:e2e -- --spec "cypress/e2e/complete-flow.cy.js"`
- [ ] Verify all assertions pass
- [ ] Check no console errors
- [ ] Confirm test execution time is acceptable
- [ ] Run full test suite to ensure no regressions
