E2E tests have regressed from 100% passing to 35/44 passing (79.5% success rate). Need to investigate and fix the failing tests.

**Failing Tests:**
1. complete-flow.cy.js: 1 failing (toast notification not found)
2. force-graph-interactions.cy.js: 1 failing (widget component not found)
3. local-mode.cy.js: 1 failing (local mode error message not displayed)
4. user-interactions.cy.js: 3 failing (API calls not being made)

**Root Cause Analysis Needed:**
- Check if recent changes broke notification system
- Verify widget initialization in different modes
- Investigate API call patterns in user interactions
- Ensure proper error handling in local mode

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All 44 E2E tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality
- [ ] Proper error handling in all scenarios
- [ ] Notification system working correctly
